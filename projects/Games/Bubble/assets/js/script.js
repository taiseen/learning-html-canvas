/**
 * this is a great time to skill up and change your life
 * the question is not --> is it possible to get a job... 
 * the question is --> do you want it hard enough to invest in yourself and do what it takes...
 * you are searching for coding videos on the internet... 
 * so i'd say you are already ahead of so many people...
 * who don't take action, well done...
 * 
 * to be successful you need to be prolific at least for a while 
 * 
 * you need to learn create and repeat over and over 
 * until it becomes easy, it will happen faster than you think... *
