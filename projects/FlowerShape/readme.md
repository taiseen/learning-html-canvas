```
we will learn how to draw shapes with javascript &
we will use the basic knowledge in a powerful way to draw randomized fibonacci flowers.

canvas element is a special type of html tag
that basically creates a drawing board.

where we can use javascript to create interactive circles, rectangles, lines & so much more.

we can use 2 different api's to draw on canvas.
api in this case means a set of built-in properties & methods.

like:-
.fillRect() method to draw a rectangle,
.fillStyle for color,
.arc() method to draw a circular path
these methods are part of canvas api which largely focuses on 2d graphics

the other type is so called webgl api
which also uses html canvas element to draw hardware accelerated 2d and 3d graphics
so to use javascript to draw on html5 canvas.
